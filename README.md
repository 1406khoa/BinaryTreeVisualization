## Challenges and Solutions ⚔️

### 1. Animation Synchronization 🔄

- **Problem:** Synchronizing multiple animations while ensuring visual clarity.
- **Solution:** Utilized Blazor’s rendering lifecycle and optimized state management to maintain animation fluidity.

### 2. DFS Animation Challenges 🕵

- **Problem:** Creating animations that accurately represent the recursive exploration and backtracking process of DFS.
- **Solution:** Implemented recursive stack-based animation control, ensuring the controller "discovers" nodes dynamically in the correct DFS order.

### 3. BFS Animation Handling 🚀

- **Problem:** Managing queue-based animations to accurately simulate BFS traversal while keeping the flow visually smooth.
- **Solution:** Developed a queue-based animation system to handle real-time node exploration and state updates, ensuring smooth transitions between nodes.

### 4. Node Highlighting Issues 🔍

- **Problem:** Controller animations caused visual glitches such as "jerky" movements or failure to remain stationary on the target node.
- **Solution:** Refined animation timing and movement logic using interpolation techniques to ensure precise and smooth node transitions.

### 5. Tree Rotation Animation in AVL 🌍

- **Problem:** Simulating the actual circular rotation of tree nodes during AVL balancing, ensuring the animation reflects the rotational behavior intuitively and fluidly.
- **Solution:** Implemented trigonometric transformations and interpolations to represent smooth circular paths while preserving tree structure during AVL balancing.
